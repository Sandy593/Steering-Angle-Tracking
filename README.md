# Steering-Angle-Tracking

Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator, Training mode is used to collect training data by driving through the tracks and recording the driving data in a folder. The Nvidia model was adopted for training, the network consists of 9 layers, including a normalization layer, 5 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers. Obtained train loss of 4.29%  and validation loss of 7.16%.The trained model is tested on the Udacity's simulator autonomous mode and the car could drive on the track smoothly.
